/*
CSS Positioning
The FLOAT and POSITION properties allow us to modify the natural position of any element in the HTML document
The browser places each element considering the order in which it appears in the document and its display type depending on whether it is an inline or block element
FLOAT and POSITION allow us to modify this behavior

Floating Elements:
- float: Turns an element into a floating element, shifting it to the far left or far right of its original position
- clear: Clears the float (left, right, both)

Types of Positioning:
- static (default)
- relative
- absolute
- fixed
- sticky

To move positioned elements, the following properties are activated:
- top (vertical - Y-axis)
- bottom (vertical - Y-axis)
- left (horizontal - X-axis)
- right (horizontal - X-axis)
- z-index (depth - Z-axis)

The top and left properties take precedence over bottom and right, respectively
These 5 properties do not work with the static value
*/

/* static: This is the default value, it means that the element respects the flow of the HTML document, so it cannot be moved or positioned */

.static {
	background-color: cornflowerblue;
	position: static;
	top: 10px;
	left: 10px;
}

/* relative: The element keeps its original dimensions and position in the document flow.
If it is moved it takes as reference its original position */

.relative {
	background-color: coral;
	position: relative;
	width: 300px;
	top: 20px;
	left: 50px;
}
