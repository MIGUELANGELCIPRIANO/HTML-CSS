/*
TRANSITIONS 
transition-property: Defines the CSS properties on which the transition effect should be applied
transition-duration: Sets the time it should take for a transition animation to complete. By default, the value is 0s
transition-timing-function: Sets how intermediate values are calculated for CSS properties that are affected by a transition effect
    - linear: Transitions at a uniform speed
    - ease: Increase speed towards the middle of the transition and slow down again at the end
    - ease-in: Starts slowly, increasing the speed of transition to completion
    - ease-out: Starts transition quickly, slowing as transition continues
    - ease-in-out: Starts transition slowly, accelerates and then slows down again
    - steps( n, <jumpterm>): Displays the transition over "n" stops along the transition, showing each stop for equal periods of time
        - jump-start: Denotes a continuous function on the left, so that the first jump occurs when the transition begins
        - jump-end: Denotes a continuous function to the right, so that the last jump occurs at the end of the animation
        - jump-none: No jump at either end
        - jump-both: Includes pauses at the 0% and 100% marks, effectively adding a step during transition time
transition-delay: Specifies the time to wait between the change of a property and the beginning of a transition effect

Shorthand property: 
transition: property duration timing-function delay
